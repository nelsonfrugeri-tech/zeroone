# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Zeroone Agent
- **`zeroone` agent** (#63) — ecosystem controller agent. Detects drift between the zeroone repo and `~/.claude/` deployed agents/skills, syncs agents/skills to `~/.claude/`, sets up project workspaces with Qdrant collections, and checks memory infrastructure health (Qdrant + Ollama).

### Added — Workspaces
- **`workspaces/` directory** (#63) — per-project knowledge base convention. Each project gets a `workspaces/{project}/` directory with `context.md`, `decisions.md`, and `runbook.md`. Agents discover workspaces via `ZEROONE_HOME` env var.

### Added — Infra
- **`infra/docker-compose.yml`** (#63) — Qdrant v1.17.1 service with persistent volume, health check, and ports 6333/6334. Ollama runs native (not containerized) per Local AI Performance principle.
- **`infra/README.md`** (#63) — infrastructure startup guide: Qdrant via compose, Ollama native, `nomic-embed-text` model requirement, port reference, health check, and troubleshooting.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-10

_New phase — starting point for the next evolution of agents and skills._

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Highlights

Complete ecosystem overhaul: 9 legacy agents replaced by 7 Matrix Personas, knowledge base expanded from 8 to 16 skills,
three-level scoped memory system, Oracle as single entry point for all feature work, multi-agent GitHub auth,
and deterministic enforcement hooks for the dev pipeline.

### Added — Agents
- **7 Matrix Persona agents** (#23) — replaced 9 legacy agents (founds/experts) with 6 persona-based agents sharing the same skills: the_architect, neo, trinity, morpheus, oracle, cypher
- **`reviewer` agent** (#43) — dedicated read-only code reviewer with `disallowedTools: [Write, Edit]` enforcement. Reviews code quality, security (OWASP Top 10), patterns; posts findings via GitHub MCP comments with severity classification (`[BLOCKER]`, `[MAJOR]`, `[MINOR]`, `[NIT]`)

### Added — Skills
- **7 new state-of-the-art skills** (#24)
  - `sre-observability` — OpenTelemetry, SLOs, incident response, dashboards
  - `local-infrastructure` — Docker, compose, databases, service orchestration
  - `software-architecture` — SOLID, ADR, C4, trade-offs, API design
  - `dev-methodology` — full dev workflow, TDD, refactoring, vertical slicing
  - `research` — search strategies, source validation, synthesis, debate frameworks
  - `meta-orchestration` — task routing, agent coordination, Mem0 management
  - `qa` — E2E testing, Definition of Done, environment setup/teardown
- **`dev-pipeline` skill** (#26) — mandatory delivery pipeline: CODE → SELF-JUDGE → QA → PR → REVIEW → FIX loop. 8 reference files covering stages, transitions, self-judge checklist, QA protocol, review handoff, and templates

### Added — Memory
- **Three-level scoped memory system** (#25) — adapted from bike-shop Memory System v0.3.0
  - Three scopes: `team` (global), `team:{project}` (project), `{agent}:{project}` (agent)
  - 5 primary memory types: `decision`, `fact`, `preference`, `procedure`, `outcome`
  - New `mem0_recall_context` tool — queries all 3 scopes in one call with retrieval budget (~13 items)
  - Save protocol: classify scope → classify type → check duplicates → store/update
  - Memory hygiene criteria with per-scope cleanup protocol
  - All agents updated with Memory Scoping section
  - `meta-orchestration` skill rewritten with three-level scoping, retrieval flow, and save protocol

### Added — Orchestration
- **Oracle as single entry point** (#27) — 6-phase orchestration flow (discovery, planning, distribution, monitoring, review orchestration, merge), communication protocol with SendMessage patterns, delegation template, explicit boundaries (no code, no review, no merge without user confirmation)

### Added — Auth & Security
- **Multi-agent GitHub auth** — per-agent env vars (`GITHUB_APP_{AGENT}_*`) with fallback to generic vars. Oracle, Neo, and The Architect registered. All secrets moved to `${ENV_VAR}` references in `.mcp.json` — zero hardcoded credentials

### Added — Enforcement Hooks
- **`settings.json` hooks registration** (#42) — enforcement hooks wired into harness: `require-qa-evidence.sh` on `PreToolUse(mcp__github__github_create_pr)`, `verify-tests-passed.sh` on `Stop`, `validate-task-completion.sh` on `TaskCompleted`. Deny rules added: `git push origin main`, `git push --force*`, `rm -rf *`
- **3 enforcement hooks** (#39, #40, #41) — deterministic quality gates for the dev pipeline
  - `hooks/require-qa-evidence.sh` — PreToolUse: blocks `mcp__github__github_create_pr` if no QA evidence file exists
  - `hooks/verify-tests-passed.sh` — Stop: blocks agent from stopping without test evidence; supports pytest, npm test, cargo test, go test, jest, rspec, phpunit
  - `hooks/validate-task-completion.sh` — TaskCompleted: blocks task completion if no commits ahead of base branch or no test evidence found

### Added — Standards
- **Language Rules** foundational principle in CLAUDE.md — strict language separation by context (pt-BR for skills/agents prose, English for code/docs/README)

### Changed
- **All 16 skills** now declare "Skill global — carregada automaticamente por todos os agents" (#32)
- **Oracle** rewritten from ecosystem manager to single entry point for all feature work (#27)

### Fixed
- **Hook JSON schema for Stop and TaskCompleted events** (#50) — hooks now use the correct schema `{"decision": "approve|block", "reason": "..."}`
- **qa-report.md in hooks/ bypassing enforcement** (#50) — all three hooks now exclude `hooks/` directory from find
- **pr-docs-check.sh diff against wrong HEAD** (#52) — now extracts `--head` branch from the `gh pr create` command
- **GitHub MCP PEM path unexpanded env var detection** (#51) — clear error message when `pem_path` is a literal unexpanded shell variable
- **Worktree paths in test evidence search** — hooks now exclude worktree paths from find

### Removed
- **9 legacy agents** (#22, #23) — founds/experts architecture replaced by Matrix Personas
- **Legacy memory-keeper hooks** (#22) — `memory-keeper-restore.sh`, `memory-keeper-save.sh`, `memory-keeper-purge.sh` fully removed

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Frontend ecosystem**: 3 new skills + 2 new expert agents (44 files, ~15,300 lines)
  - **arch-ts** skill — TypeScript/Frontend architecture: type system, React patterns, RSC, state management, testing, tooling (19 reference files)
  - **review-ts** skill — Frontend code review: templates, checklist (28 checks), severity criteria, accessibility + styling categories (7 files)
  - **frontend-design** skill — UI/UX/Visual design: OKLCH colors, fluid typography, modern CSS layout, motion, UX patterns, WCAG 2.2, shadcn/ui ecosystem, 2026 visual trends (16 reference files)
  - **dev-ts** agent — TypeScript/Frontend developer with 8-step workflow, test-first, accessibility-first, bundle-aware
  - **review-ts** agent — Systematic frontend code review between git branches with accessibility and bundle impact analysis
- **Semantic Memory MCP server** (`mcp/mem0-server/`) — shared vector memory via Qdrant + Ollama embeddings
  - 6 tools: `mem0_store`, `mem0_recall`, `mem0_search`, `mem0_list`, `mem0_delete`, `mem0_update`
  - No LLM required — Claude Code handles intelligence, server is pure storage + semantic search
  - Persistent memory across terminals and sessions
  - Metadata: type (feedback/project/reference/decision/procedural), project, tags
  - Local embeddings via Ollama (nomic-embed-text) + Qdrant vector DB
- **Multi-Oracle coordination** via Agent Teams + Mem0 shared memory
  - Coordination memory types: `task_claim`, `blocker`, `progress`, `conflict`
  - Startup/shutdown protocols for multi-instance coordination
  - Task deduplication and conflict detection via Mem0
  - Team patterns: parallel experts, research+build, multi-Oracle
- **Worktree enforcement hook** (`hooks/enforce-worktree.sh`) — deterministic SessionStart hook that blocks sessions not in a worktree
  - Tests: 5 cases (main repo blocked, worktree allowed, non-git allowed, empty cwd, actionable error message)
- **`github_merge_pr` tool** in GitHub MCP server — merge PRs via bot identity with merge/squash/rebase support
- **Semantic Router** in founds agents — dynamic model selection (haiku/sonnet/opus), thinking depth, and expert delegation based on task complexity
- `.mcp.json.example` — template with all MCP server configs and env var placeholders
- `isolation: worktree` enforced on all 9 agents
- Foundational principles in CLAUDE.md:
  - "GitHub Operations" — all GitHub writes must use MCP tools
  - "Branch Discipline" — one branch per change, never commit to a branch under review
  - "Dependency Pinning" — exact versions only (`==`), never `>=`
  - "Local AI Performance" — native inference, no thinking models for automation
  - "Agent Isolation" expanded — scope changed from agents-only to all sessions + agents; enforcement via hook

### Changed
- **Workspace → Mem0 migration**: all agents now use Mem0 for project context instead of `.claude/workspace/` files
  - Explorer, Builder, dev-py, dev-ts, review-py, review-ts, architect all migrated
  - Oracle knowledge base moved from markdown files to Mem0
  - 23 memories migrated successfully
- Oracle agent rewritten: markdown knowledge base → Mem0, added Agent Teams coordination
- Oracle Semantic Router: experts and skills now discovered dynamically from directories
- Oracle frontmatter: added arch-ts, review-ts, frontend-design skills
- GitHub MCP server: removed `apps.json` — all credentials now via env vars
- GitHub skill updated to reference env vars instead of apps.json
- All dependencies pinned to exact stable versions (mcp==1.26.0, qdrant-client==1.17.1, httpx==0.28.1, PyJWT==2.12.1, pydantic==2.12.5)
- Debater agent: replaced hardcoded personal paths with `$HOME` env var

### Removed
- `setup/` directory — stale bootstrap; MCPs now configured via `.mcp.json`
- `mcp/github-server/apps.json` — replaced by env vars
- `hooks/memory-keeper-restore.sh`, `memory-keeper-save.sh`, `memory-keeper-purge.sh` — replaced by Mem0 MCP
- Memory-keeper hooks from `settings.json` (SessionStart, PreCompact, Stop)
- `mcp__memory-keeper__*` permission from settings.json

### Changed
- Reorganized agents into `founds/` (oracle, sentinel) and `experts/` (architect, dev-py, review-py, debater, tech-pm, explorer, builder)
- CLAUDE.md rewritten with founds/experts architecture, autonomy rules, and PR checklist
- README rewritten — project-agnostic, with autonomy and PR standards docs
